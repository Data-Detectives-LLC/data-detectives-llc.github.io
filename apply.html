							<h2>Why Apply?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This internship is focused on your growth and experience as a data detective. You will learn how to think about data problems, create your own datasets, explore different modeling techniques, and wrap up your project into a portfolio piece you can take to future job opportunities. You will receive direct mentorship from a staff+ machine learning engineer at a Fortune 500 company and learn to apply the skills you've studied in school to real-world problems. At the end of the internship, you will have produced a case file, so please look at the <a href="case_files.html">existing ones</a> for examples of what you could do.</p>

							<h4>1. Submit an Application</h4>
							<p>While there are no strict qualifications and we accept aspiring data detectives at all stages of their studies or careers, our primary goal is to provide meaningful mentorship. As such, we will prioritize:</p>
							<p>> Currently enrolled students who have completed or aim to complete coursework relevant to data science</p>
							<p>> Applicants with little to no prior work experience in a data field</p>
							<p>> Applicants with a demonstrated or communicated eagerness to improve their data intuition</p>
							<p>For those interested, please submit a 1-page cover letter and a copy of your resume to <a href="mailto:richard@datadetectiveslearning.com">richard@datadetectiveslearning.com</a>.</p>
						</section>

							<span class="icon fa-gem style4"></span>
							<h4>2. Complete an Interview</h4>
							<p>Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, meaning that interviews can be scheduled and positions filled as soon as applications arrive.</p>
							<p>When your application is received, you should receive a notification of receipt, and once your application has been reviewed, you should receive a request for an interview or a polite rejection.</p>
							<p>If you proceed to the interview, the interview itself will assess your current capabilities as well as your desires to grow, concomitant with what is stated in your cover letter.</p>
							<p>Once completed, we ask for your patience in returning communication.</p>
